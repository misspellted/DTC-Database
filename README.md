# DTC-Database
A database of diagnostic trouble code descriptions.

There are currently 6665 unique codes in the database

## Available Data Formats
The data is available in XML and JSON formats, which are detailed below. In the
future, CSV will be added.

The JSON data is based on the XML data, and can be regenerated by running the
included Python script:
```python codes.py```

### XML
The XML format is as follows:
```
<codes>
    <code code="P1000">Example code</code>
    <code ...>...</code>
</codes>
```

### JSON
The JSON data is formatted as such:
```
{
    "codes": [
        {
            "code": "P1000",
            "text": "Example code"
        },
        {
            "code": "...",
            "text": "..."
        }
    ]
}
```

## Errors
These descriptions are a combination of many databases and I cannot check for correctnesss in each one so some descriptions may be malformed. If you happen to find an error, please submit an issue or pull request.
